There’re a lot of banks and money transfer options I’m listing down in my opinion very essential to everyone.

- **[N26 Bank](https://n26.com/r/attiae4574)**  
    The most famous online bank in Europe 🇪🇺, You can easily open an account in this bank _even you’re still in Egypt_ **but you should know an address here to receive your card there.** you just need to make a verification video call with your passport next to you 😊
- **[Transferwise](https://transferwise.com/invite/i/attiae)**  
    If your family still in Egypt and or any of your beloved ones you will definitely sometime need to transfer money to them 💸. This is one of the easiest, most reliable solutions, they have a very neat mobile app, you can easily transfer money in 5 mins with a good rate. _Money usually takes 2 days to be in Cairo_.
